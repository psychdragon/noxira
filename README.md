A blockchain-powered social media platform where users own their data, earn from their contributions, and participate in platform governance.

## 🌐 Overview

Noxira is a next-generation social platform built on blockchain technology that puts users first. Unlike traditional social networks that extract value from user data and attention, DS distributes value to its members through a token economy that rewards contributions and enables access to premium services.

### Key Features

- **User Data Ownership**: Complete data sovereignty with encrypted storage
- **Value Distribution**: Token rewards for quality contributions and engagement
- **Community Governance**: Democratic platform decision-making
- **Censorship Resistance**: Content stored on decentralized networks
- **Service Marketplace**: Direct creator monetization with minimal fees
- **AI Integration**: Transparent, community-governed AI tools

## 🚀 Project Status

**Current Phase**: Foundation (Phase 1)

We are currently building the core architecture and assembling our team. This repository serves as the central codebase for the platform's development.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, GraphQL
- **Blockchain**: EVM-compatible Layer 2 (Optimism/Arbitrum)
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Storage**: IPFS/Arweave
- **Authentication**: Decentralized identity (DID)
- **Services**: AI integrations, marketplace infrastructure
