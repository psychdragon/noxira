## Vision

Nexera is building a new era of social connectivity where:

## The Problem

### Today's Social Media Landscape

- **Centralized Control**: Platforms exercise unilateral authority
- **Value Extraction**: User engagement monetized for shareholder benefit
- **Data Exploitation**: Personal information collected and sold
- **Opacity**: Black-box algorithms determine content visibility
- **Misaligned Incentives**: Engagement optimization over user wellbeing
