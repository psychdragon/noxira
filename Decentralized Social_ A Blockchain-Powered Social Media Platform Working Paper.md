# Decentralized Social: A Blockchain-Powered Social Media Platform
## Working Paper | May 2025

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This working paper outlines the vision, architecture, and implementation strategy for "Decentralized Social" (DS), a blockchain-based social media platform that leverages decentralized technologies to create a community-owned digital ecosystem. Unlike traditional social networks that extract value from user data and attention, DS distributes value to its members through a token economy that rewards contributions and enables access to premium services.

The platform will launch with an invitation-only membership model to build a quality-focused community before expanding to broader public access. The native utility token (DST) will power all in-platform transactions while keeping basic membership free, ensuring accessibility while maintaining economic sustainability.

This document serves as a blueprint for developers, potential investors, and founding community members to understand the technical requirements, economic model, and development roadmap necessary to bring DS from concept to reality.

## 2. Market Analysis

### 2.1 Problems with Current Social Media Platforms

* **Centralized Control**: Major platforms exercise unilateral content moderation and platform governance
* **Data Exploitation**: User data is harvested and monetized without proportional compensation
* **Value Extraction**: Creator value is captured primarily by platform owners rather than distributed to users
* **Privacy Concerns**: Opaque data usage policies and security vulnerabilities
* **Algorithmic Opacity**: Content distribution mechanisms lack transparency
* **Engagement-Based Business Models**: Optimize for attention rather than quality or user well-being

### 2.2 Market Opportunity

* Growing demand for user-owned alternatives to traditional social media
* Expanding Web3 adoption creating familiarity with decentralized applications
* Maturing blockchain infrastructure enabling scalable social applications
* Emerging creator economy seeking more favorable economics
* Increasing regulatory pressure on centralized platforms

### 2.3 Competitive Landscape

| Platform | Decentralization | Token Economy | Governance | Primary Focus |
|----------|-----------------|--------------|------------|---------------|
| DS (Our Platform) | Full | Utility & Governance | Community | Social + Services |
| Mastodon | Partial | None | Instance Owners | Social Networking |
| Lens Protocol | Full | Limited | Protocol | Social Graph |
| Mirror | Partial | Limited | Writers | Publishing |
| Farcaster | Partial | None | Protocol | Social Networking |
